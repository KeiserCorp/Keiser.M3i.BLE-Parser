Keiser M3i Bluetooth LE Broadcast Parser
========================

This parser library allows raw broadcast data to be parsed into a highly portable *Broadcast* object.

### Implementation

This parser should be fed data directly from the Bluetooth LE scanner callback method without any modifications
